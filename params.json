{"name":"LKDE: KDE4 fork with KDE3 features","tagline":"","body":"KDE4 is bloatware with useless features and kid visuals. Please, help to return it to serious well-functional shell!\r\n\r\nLKDE stands for 'Lightweight KDE'. My vision is to get it to stable popular condition and merge it back to KDE4 (because they will want it).\r\n\r\nCurrent status is: _acquiring developers_\r\n\r\nCurrent task list:\r\n  1. establish collaborative environment\r\n  2. replace SQL config engine with old-style file-based .ini engine\r\n  3. turn off needless daemons (like Nepomuk)\r\n  4. add some missing features to taskbar\r\n  5. merge KDE3 window manager features\r\n  6. make 'Standard look and feel'\r\n  7. make these changes as switchable 'Classic mode'\r\n  1. achieve large userbase\r\n  2. merge back to KDE4\r\n\r\n\r\n**!!! WANTED !!! WANTED !!! WANTED !!!**\r\n\r\nBeginning programmers can achieve great experience in this project! I will teach you how to work with repositories, analyze, modify and develop code, track down all kinds of problems, improve stability and performance. Everything that you will need in large-scale hardcore high load project, you will be able to ask from me.\r\n\r\nExperienced hackers who lack KDE3 features and know that Trinity project is wrong are welcome here!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
